## Introduction:
Estimating body fat percentage is one of the crucial components in assessing an individual’s health and risk for various diseases. One of the traditional methods of measuring a person’s body fat percentage is to weigh them on dry land and then weigh them while in the water. These methods are inconvenient and costly in clinical settings. This project aims to develop a simple, robust, and accurate model to estimate body fat percentage using available clinical data such as age, weight, height, BMI, and body circumference measurements. By using the real data set of 252 men with measurements of their body fat percentage and various body circumference measurements, we will explore the trade-offs between simplicity, robustness, and accuracy, making the methods convenient for everyday use in clinical settings.
